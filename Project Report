#Project explanation.

  
Using IRS Zip Code returns data we thought we can use it to predict migration patterns. 
  Migration patterns means which states are gaining people, which are losing people.
  This migration might show details on the states loosing for example currently people are moving out of North Dakota after shale gas slump
  
  So if there is an API to select AGI and state and who how the state performed in return for that AGI in that state the tool would be useful for further analysis.

#Data Collection 

  We used IRS Returns/Zip code data. We collected 3 years of data to show either slump of boom in returns filed.

#Cleaning And Modelling data

  The template for IRS Returns/Zip code data changed every year in the last three years. So the data collected had to be cleaned properly.
 we created a new template which can be used for all the three years data and changed the pandaâ€™s data frames to this new template. 

#Data Representation 

  We tried to use Bokeh library to represent data. We faced some issues with the complexities and decided upon using ipywidgets.

 You can select zip code/State or AGI and it shows how the trend of returns in the last 3 years
